// ============================================================================
// COMPONENTS/FILTERS.SCSS - Juldyz Edition (This file is now mostly redundant)
// ============================================================================

// This file is kept for potential future use, but the primary filter UI
// is now handled by the sidebar and its styles in sidebar_styles.scss.
// The .view-mode-container and its buttons have been moved to sidebar_styles.scss
// to consolidate layout components.
